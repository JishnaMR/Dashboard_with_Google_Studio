# Business Dashboard in Google Looker Studio 

## Project Overview 

This project involves creating a comprehensive business dashboard using Google Looker Studio. The 
data source for the dashboard is Google Sheets, where pivot tables were created to aggregate and

including sales trends, customer demographics, sales by payment method, and performance across 
shopping malls.
